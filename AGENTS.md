## Versioning

This app uses semantic versioning `major.minor.patch`, bumped per release. When a
change ships, bump the app version in the **same commit**:

- **patch** — bug fix or small enhancement to existing functionality.
- **minor** — new functionality, or a large/breaking change (while the app is in `0.x`).
- **major** — reserved until the app declares a stable `1.0.0`; after that, breaking
  changes for the app's users.

Where the version lives:

- `version` in `manifest.json` is the app's release version and the source of truth —
  bump it in the same change that ships the work.
- Keep `package.json` in step, and refresh `package-lock.json` (run `npm install`) so all
  three agree.
- Do **not** bump `schemaVersion` (`app.0.1`) for ordinary changes — it tracks the Hosty
  manifest *contract* format, not this app.

Each runtime app versions independently from Hosty Core/CLI and from the other apps.
